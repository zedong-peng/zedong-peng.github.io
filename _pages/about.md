Zedong Peng is currently a Master's student in Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Jieru Zhao](https://zjru.github.io). He received his B.S. in Electronic Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2024 as Outstanding Graduate. [[Transcipts](files/pdf/TRANSCRIPT.pdf)]

He is also a research intern at the [National Center of Technology Innovation for EDA](https://www.nctieda.com/en/), working under the joint supervision of [Prof. Qiang Xu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/qiang-xu/) and [Prof. Jieru Zhao](https://zjru.github.io), where his work focuses on AI for EDA and hardware-software co-design. 

From November 2023 to July 2024, he interned at Intel Asia-Pacific Research & Development Ltd. contributing to the [Apache Gluten](https://github.com/apache/incubator-gluten) project, [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) project and developing a functional Text-to-SQL LLM demo. 

He participated in an international exchange program at the Data Science Institute, Imperial College London from January to February 2024, exploring NLP techniques for textual data analysis related to COVID-19. Earlier, from February to July 2023, he conducted research on long-tail multi-label learning with [Prof. Jiangchao Yao](https://sunarker.github.io) at the Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center, SJTU.


Between July 2022 and July 2024, he was affiliated with the [John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science](https://cs.sjtu.edu.cn), collaborating with [Prof. Liyao Xiang](http://xiangliyao.cn) on security-focused machine learning. Their joint work has been published in *IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing*.
